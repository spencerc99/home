What have I learned from this year of existence on this earth? It feels like we're in a time of extremes. Trump is back; Mamdani is mayor. Government officials are We're in an age of unprecedented growth and we're in a massive bubble on the verge of popping. AI will change the world, and it's a pyramid scheme. What is real is evolving rapidly. Abandoning language seems like a defensive mechanism. 67 is a universal language that transcends the intellectual superiority of the machine. Simple is better when we are outgunned at every turn. Old becomes real becomes good. Used becomes proof of existence. New things are easier and easier, and our capacity to tend and maintain continues to deteriorate.

This year included many personal milestones, I started the year with my first large institutional commission from Hyundai Artlab, where I made a an [art piece](https://spencer.place/creation/everyday) that lives on your phone and invites you to play with our devices in new, physical ways (later in the year, I would watch 300+ people do it together inside the Internet Archive, thank you ash & [tiat](https://tiat.place/)!). Then, I finished up my first large-scale installation of [Computing Shrines](https://spencer.place/creation/computing-shrines) for NEW INC's DEMO 2025. After, I pitched a weird and [social media piece](https://spencer.place/creation/sharing-stories), subverting Instagram to create collective art, for Alserkal Avenue, made a [tribute to the alive internet](https://spencer.place/creation/alive-internet-theory) for the Internet Archive, and brought Computing Shrines to Tokyo Geidai[^1]. I designed, prototyped, and productionized the [Phone Pillow](https://internetsculptures.com/object/phone-pillow) for my [Internet Sculptures](https://internetsculptures.com/) store. I taught and led 5 workshops in 3 cities, all towards the purpose of helping people shape software. I found a short enough tagline that feels good: "[software you can touch](https://news.spencer.place/p/software-you-can-touch)."

[^1]: I've always wanted to go here since I saw this [panel](https://www.are.na/block/25297283) from the manga Blue Period (which I encountered before I even found my interest in art). So it's especially meaningful to be invited there to show my art.

It was a year of saying yes to everything that came my way & learning how I work with different organizations and how to pitch my art to them. I set a follower goal and hit [10k](https://www.instagram.com/spence.r.chang/) in the fall. It was a year of learning how business works and how to tastefully merge my art with it—launching my second product, pitching and negotiating brand contracts, coordinating marketing, branding, and packaging, exploring manufacturing—all as a one-person team. In the process, I said yes to projects that weren't the right fit, but I couldn't have learned how to identify them without doing them.

If there's a theme for the year, it's that I embraced looking dumb in order to do new things and followed my instinct for which projects would yield interesting results. I recorded myself talking to the camera daily for a month, floundered through the basics of sculpture through so many new materials like stone, cement, resin, cork, and learned how to stop procrastinating high-pressure emails. Mostly, I've developed so many new ways of seeing.

My word for 2025—normal—gave me the mandate to not only reclaim the regular routines that make life worth living but also to establish my "different" life as the norm to compare against. I ran a half-marathon, started doing muscle-ups, danced until ungodly hours, and spent lots of time prancing in the park. I stopped hedging about what I do and what I'm going to do. I introduced myself as an artist and confidently explained how everything I do is connected to the same creative practice.

This year I don't feel an urgency to change anything. I feel an urgency to do everything I'm doing more. More ambition, experimentation, joy, repetition, patience, intention. I feel the most alive when I feel like I never have enough time for all the things I want to do while simultaneously what I've chosen to do in the moment. I want to live life feeling unbelievably grateful for every second I get.

I'm coming into the year thinking a lot about the shape of nature. How water will flow and expand into every open pathway, how fire stubbornly keeps itself alive, how when the wind bends a blade of grass, it will inevitably pop back up.

I want to bring all the work I do, the different projects, ideas, and experiments, under one umbrella, one system, one identity. I have struggled with how fragmented my work feels with how many different projects I work on, while still wanting many of them to have sustained impact (and thus requiring continued maintenance). Is there a way to bridge everything I do into a single entity that can grow beyond myself?

I want to work with friends, to expand my capability beyond myself and find what ideas can only be made from different combinations of people. I want to be generous with ideas and even more so with time. I want to feel like winning is about the team more than myself—my extended network of peers, collaborators, friends, advisors.

I want to push the bounds of the physical world. I want to make new products and prototypes and compositions. I want to create hardware and sculptures and DIY furniture and handbound gifts. I want to feel an intuition for manipulating matter regardless of the physical or emotional context.

I want to push the bounds of the digital world. I want to create spaces for discovering new ways to share intimate moments with each other. I want to create tools that empower people to reclaim the Internet from huge platforms to make it about us. I want to make websites, apps, and widgets that turn our everyday interactions with technology into poems and landscapes.

Most of all, I want to push the bounds of human relation. I want to tell stories that connect to people's hopes, worries, and curiosities and create things that help them act on those feelings. I want to bring people together, whether in-person to create things in the same room or online in spontaneous encounters with loving stranger, to discover something new about what it means to be human.

In 2026, I want to be inevitable. I want to feel like the tide rushing onto shore over and over again. I want to feel like an ember jumping from the campfire. I want to feel like that blade of grass, always raising its head defiantly no matter what pushes it down or how many times it happens.

I want to conduct more "studies" in 2026 that give me the freedom to experiment and iterate towards a final thing. Here are some areas I want to explore. Let me know if any of them spark thoughts or ideas!

1.  the mechanics of social media, the algorithm, virality, presence, brand, video content, media consumption, device usage
2.  the dynamics of our devices: phones, computers, tablets, and how we use them in private and in public
3.  our instinct for community and how encounters unfold: what makes them intimate? challenging? inspiring? long-term and sustained encounters vs. one-time encounters.
4.  how can the internet can facilitate this? how do we form spaces, how do we tell time, how do we make it feel lived in?
5.  our relationship to digital creation: how universal should it be? how much control should we have?
6.  digital fragmentation vs. universality? how do we achieve plurality while not fragmenting into completely siloed and individual experiences? how are we diverse, together?
7.  how we leave digital traces & how to create more natural digital environments and phenomena? what gives a sense of life?
