  "descriptionMd": "html garden is a seasonal website hosting an internet garden that changes day after day, season after season. filled with plant species corresponding to HTML elements.\nAt a time when so much of our digital consumption comes from an overwhelming flood of information, html garden imagines a seasonal website that offers a sanctuary of quiet change, which rewards visitors for returning. html garden is composed of digitally-native plants, each species derived from a set of related HTML elements (the fundamental building blocks for a website). These internet plants simulate the organic growth of real plants using a computational grammar that can be modified by visitors to create their own plant. \nIn the background, the ambient sounds of internet life unfold in an emergent symphony. Human voices intertwine with artificial ones as recordings of natural environments overlap with synthetic recreations. \nVisitors are encouraged to take a stroll through and use their inherent browser mechanisms to zoom in and take a closer peek at the plants that call to them. Each species has its own aesthetic quirks and interaction mechanisms according to its personality that reveal themselves upon closer attention. Regulars who visit repeatedly over time are rewards with sights of growth in each plant along with new budding offspring as the website grows each day and changes with each season.\nSituating viewers in an environment of close attention, html garden prompts us to imagine alternate forms of digital being where technology can be a medium for human connection and attention.\n*html garden* was created for[ thehtml.review](http://thehtml.review), exhibited in Amsterdam, New York (CultureHub), and San Francisco (the de Young Museum), and featured in[ Frieze](https://www.frieze.com/article/online-publications-bridging-poetry-and-code) and[ MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/21/1084525/internet-whimsy-html-energy/).",
