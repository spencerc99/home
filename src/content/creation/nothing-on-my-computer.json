  "descriptionMd": "*nothing on my computer* is a 24-hour live screenshare that transforms the intimate space of a personal desktop into a meditation on the meaning in our digital presence. Compressing a 1920x1080 pixel space into 84 pixels, the piece renders actions full of personal meaning and information, like text messages and web browsing, into a shifting canvas of colors that hint at the person they belonged to. A live feed focused on the cursor and keypresses highlight these everyday interactions with our computer as main subjects. \n&nbsp;\nViewers are invited to piece together narratives from these fragments while confronting questions about the nature of our everyday digital actions: How much personality do our digital limbs carry? How do we form connection in digital space? And how have our devices changed us?\n&nbsp;\n*nothing on my computer* was originally streamed live over 24 hours for THING's [DO-NOTHING stream](https://www.instagram.com/p/DEK9CxsswIt/) supported by [Nguyen Wahed Gallery](https://nguyenwahed.com/) and [Museum of the Moving Image](https://movingimage.org/).",
