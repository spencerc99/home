  "descriptionMd": "playhtml is an [open-source library](https://github.com/spencerc99/playhtml) for designing communal internet experiences by enhancing web elements with real-time, collaborative interactivity.\nWhy do websites feel lonely even though so much humanity is woven through the internet these days? I think it's largely because most of the internet is designed around a personal experience. We need new imaginations and speculations for what the web could be and who we could be on it.\nplayhtml aims to provide the infrastructure for making new diverse and open forms of \"social media\" that make the [web feel alive](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/ti-08-aliving-the-web). By providing the means to shape the way we interact with each other on the web, I invite people to imagine what websites can become and who we can become when we inhabit them.\nPart community infrastructure, part personal tool, and part interactive art collection, playhtml pushes the boundaries of what art can be—it’s definition constantly shifting relative to the viewer’s perspective. This infrastructural art posits how art can become not only a [useful](https://pioneerworks.org/broadcast/caroline-sinders-in-defense-of-useful-art) tool for speculative action but also an interactive environment that engages with communities in their everyday lives.\nI’ve hosted workshops at [If, Then](https://ifthen.cargo.site/) and [Gray Area](https://grayarea.org/) around creating neighborhood internets using playhtml. Example websites created by attendees can be found in the open [Arena channel](https://www.are.na/spencer-chang/playhtml-sites). Thousands of people use playhtml on their own websites and visit the broader archipelago of playhtml experiments & games to find connection in an increasingly fractured digital world. \nplayhtml has been used by tens of thousands of people across the Internet and adopted in hundreds of websites, from personal sites to birthday gifts and local community gathering places. \nSee also [poems we found with the internet](https://spencer.place/creation/poems-we-found-with-the-internet) for an example of a live game made with the library and [neighborhood internets workshop](https://spencer.place/creation/neighborhood-internets-workshop) for a workshop I taught at Gray Area (and the \\~30 websites/games created by participants!)",
