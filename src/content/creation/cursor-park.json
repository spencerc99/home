  "descriptionMd": "\"cursor park\" reimagines an everyday productivity tool into a communal canvas. This piece takes its cue from the whimsical 'cursor park' trend, an ASCII art that serves as a virtual resting place for cursors in a shared document, emerging as a collective moment of stillness amidst the digital hustle.\nThrough a satirical form, “cursor park” challenges viewers to perceive our everyday digital actions and interactions as artistic expressions comparable to fine art. Co-opting a space traditionally dedicated to long lines of text towards optimizing efficiency, this piece gives space for the cursors, our digital embodiments, to become the storytellers in an ongoing performance. Each cursor embodies an individual's presence, their movements composing a narrative of coexistence.\nInviting visitors to observe, engage, and perform, \"cursor park\" is a testament to the collective narrative we create in our interconnected digital landscape, a narrative crafted with our very presence.",
