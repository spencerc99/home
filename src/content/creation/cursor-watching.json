  "descriptionMd": "Surveillance involves a kind of watching that invokes fear, while seeing one another with full attention is called \"the rarest and purest form of generosity\" by Simone Weil. While I hate the idea of a government watching through my webcam, sitting in a public park and people-watching is one of my greatest pleasures. When we use the web, we inhabit a world that exists simultaneously within these two extremes: our data extracted by platforms and logged by governments while we bear witness to acts of love between strangers in the depths of a forum.\n&nbsp;\nSituating visitors in a position of surveillance and simulating a large surveillance feed, cursor watching reveals itself, upon closer attention, to be a collection of live windows looking onto various corners of the internet. \n&nbsp;\nEach \"video feed\" shares a live window into websites from across the internet that show the life and actions of present and past visitors. The frames are zoomed in on displaced corners and unusual details of the websites to create surreal compositions that render even familiar places strange. Across the different feeds, the life of the internet unfolds: from the traces of former visitors to real-time movement and croaking to the neverending movement of GIFs. When installed physically, cursor watching features a mobile activation, which empowers their phones to induct them as performers in the piece.\n&nbsp;\nUnlike a static surveillance feed, visitors can choose to interact with the featured sites, recording themselves into the history of the website, or embrace lurking and simply watch.\n&nbsp;\nSwitching between these modes yields conflicting emotions: the whimsy that comes from watching the movements of people and the voyeurism that comes from watching while unseen. Presenting our everyday internet activity as a collective performance, the site serves as an ode to the diverse life unfolding in every moment on the internet and positions the attention we pay one another on these internet corners as paths for liberation from an oppressive kind of watching.\n&nbsp;\n*cursor watching* has been exhibited in New York and nominated for a [Tiny Award](https://tinyawards.net/).",
