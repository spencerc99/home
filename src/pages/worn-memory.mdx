# Field Companions: Worn Memory

You can always refer back to this website: https://spencer.place/worn-memory

## Introduction

My name is Spencer Chang. I am an independent engineer and internet artist based in New York. My work explores communal computing - ways that computers can bring people together and help us shape technology toward what we care about.

I create experiments that examine our relationship with technology and with each other through technology. These include seasonal websites, open-source tools for building small social networks, and physical objects embedded with digital memories.

You can see more of my work at https://spencer.place

## Background: My Practice

Over the past several years, I have been exploring how we can create more intimate and meaningful relationships with digital technology. This work takes several forms.

### Field Companions

<SelectedCreationSummary slug="field-companions" />

Field companions are everyday objects that become portals to digital memories. By embedding NFC chips into found objects and personal items, we create physical touchpoints for accessing digital experiences that matter to us.

### Computing Shrines

<SelectedCreationSummary slug="computing-shrines" />

Computing shrines are site-specific sculptures that create communal web interfaces. These physical installations allow people to access shared digital spaces through their phones at specific locations.

### Webstones

<SelectedCreationSummary slug="computing-infused-objects" />

These ceramic internet sculptures contain RFID chips. Each piece serves as a physical key to digital content, creating a tangible connection between physical objects and online spaces.

### Teaching Others

<SelectedCreationSummary slug="touching-computers-creating-data-talismans" />

I regularly teach workshops where participants create their own hybrid objects. These workshops show people how to infuse personal artifacts with digital memory using NFC technology.

## Today's Workshop: Worn Memory

In this workshop, we will embed stories inside clothing and create a system for passing down memories through generations.

The process has several steps:

1. You will personalize a clothing item by drawing designs with fabric markers
2. You will stamp your personal hanko to mark your presence on the garment
3. You will create a visible alteration that reflects your personal style
4. You will record a memory about your relationship with this piece of clothing
5. You will embed this memory using an NFC tag attached inside the clothing

<img src="https://yoshinarinishio.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pubrobe_01.jpg" />

This approach builds on <a href="https://yoshinarinishio.net/works/pubrobe/">Pubrobe</a>, a public wardrobe project by Yoshinari Nishio, which welcomes the public to offer their clothes to each other as a common resource.

Each garment in that project carries the story that the previous owner had with it.

Our system allows for growth over time. When someone passes the garment on, the next owner can add their own story before giving it away again. This creates evolving narrative objects. Each garment accumulates a growing archive of stories as it moves through different hands.

In daily life, the visible alteration creates opportunities for intimate exchange. When you meet friends and strangers, the design invites them to discover your story.

## Ice-breaker Questions

Please take a moment to introduce yourself and share:

- What clothing item did you bring today?
- What is your relationship to this piece?
- Have you ever inherited or passed down clothing before?

## Understanding NFC Technology

NFC stands for Near Field Communication. This technology allows two devices to communicate when they are very close together - within a few centimeters.

When you tap your phone to make a payment (Apple Pay, Google Pay, or other mobile payment systems), you are using NFC.

When you tap your phone or card to pay for subway or train tickets, you are using a form of NFC.

Most modern smartphones have NFC capability built in. This technology has become standard over the past several years.

## Programming Your NFC Chip

To program your NFC chip, you will need to download the NFC Tools application on your phone.

This application is available for both iOS (iPhone) and Android devices.

![NFC Tools](https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple211/v4/7e/b8/e3/7eb8e32a-1c19-0a1d-d5fb-ad54c22238bd/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-4-85-220.png/1200x630wa.png)

## Workshop Instructions

Please follow these steps to create your worn memory:

### 1. Consider Your Garment

Think about your relationship with the clothing item you brought:

- Why does this garment matter to you?
- What memories does it hold?
- What story do you want to preserve?

### 2. Design and Mark

Use fabric markers to draw designs that represent your story. Stamp your personal hanko to mark your presence on the garment. The design should reflect your personal style.

### 3. Record Your Story

Record a memory about this piece of clothing. Explain why it matters to you, where it came from, and what it represents. This recording will be embedded in the garment through the NFC chip.

### 4. Program the NFC Chip

Use the NFC Tools application to program your chip with a link to your recorded story. Attach the chip inside the clothing.

### 5. Create a Visible Mark

Make a design element that shows where someone should tap their phone. This design invites others to discover your story.

## Questions to Consider

As you work, think about these questions:

- What makes this garment meaningful to you?
- What story do you want to preserve about your relationship with it?
- When you pass this garment on, what do you want the next person to know?
- How can your design reflect your personal style while inviting interaction?

## The Future of Your Garment

Worn memory creates objects that grow over time. When you are ready to pass your garment to someone else, they can:

1. Tap the NFC chip to hear all the previous stories
2. Add their own memory to the collection
3. Make their own alteration to the design
4. Pass it on again when they are ready

Each garment becomes a living archive. It accumulates voices, relationships, and memories as it moves through different hands.

## Advanced Options

If you would like to explore more advanced features:

- If you have trouble getting NFC to work, please check the [troubleshooting guide](https://internetsculptures.com/setup)
- iPhone users can use Apple Shortcuts to create automatic actions when tapping the NFC chip. This removes the need to click a prompt each time. More [information is available here](https://internetsculptures.com/setup).
- Android users can use third-party applications such as NFC Tasks to program more complex actions.

## Sharing Your Work

I would be grateful to see what you create. If you are willing to share your work, you can:

- Send pictures and information about what you made to spencer@spencer.place
- Add directly to <a href="https://www.are.na/spencer-chang/field-companions-worn-memory">this are.na channel</a>

Thank you for participating in this workshop.
