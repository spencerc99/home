# Field Companions: Worn Memory

Hi everyone, thanks for coming today. I'm an artist from San Francisco, and I'm fortunate to be joined by Nishio-san from Tokyo Geidai who created the project, Pubrobe, which imagines a public wardrobes in the same way we have public libraries. Today, we'll be doing a workshop and project that combines my work creating interactive sculptures with Nishio-san's work creating public wardrobe.

## Pubrobe

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Spencer Chang. I'm an artist and engineer based in San Francisco. My work focuses on "communal computing" — forms of technology that bring people together and help us shape it for our imagination. I create "software you can touch," from websites that play out on your own devices and with personal data to interactive sculptures that invite intimate encounters between strangers to infrastructure that enables others to create their own forms of software.

I believe the internet and technology broadly is a mirror of our relationships to each other. I want it to feel as accessible of a creation material as writing is today.

## Webstones

You may have seen some of this work out there. Computing shrines are site-specific sculptures that create communal web interfaces. These physical installations allow people to access shared digital spaces through their phones at specific locations.

Field companions are everyday objects that become portals to digital memories. By embedding NFC chips into found objects and personal items, we create physical touchpoints for accessing digital experiences that matter to us.

All of these are artworks that combine physical and digital craft.

  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="computing-infused-objects" />
  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="field-companions" />
</div>

we'll call them webstones to describe objects that are embedded with software that is specific to them.

The central idea focuses around creating software for a specific object or place rather than something universal like typical software is created these days. This software is personal.

I created my very first one as a vessel for my website.

Then I created Field Companions out of found stones in places that have personal meaning to me: local parks and streets. They hold audio from where they were located in this orange chip. became a way to incorporate found materials with my own personality.

And recently I created Computing Shrines, site-specific sculptures that create communal web interfaces. These physical installations allow people to access shared digital spaces through their phones at specific locations.

Computing Shrines and Field Companions are both on view in the showcase out there,
so please take a look after this.

I started teaching workshops to share these ideas with others, in various forms: 1) creating sculptures out of clay and embedding software function in them, 2) embedding software into found and personal objects.

## [WORKSHOP] Field Companions: Worn Memory

In this workshop, we will embed stories inside clothing and create a system for passing down memories through generations.

One of my favorite things to do is buying secondhand items. Clothing, books, furniture, and art all have stories of their previous wearers. Sometimes they are very obvious, like a jacket with the wearers name written on the label. Other times they give you intimate details without knowing who the person is, like the annotations in a book. Sometimes they are more subtle, like the small stains and scratches left in used chairs and tables. These things make these items more valuable to me than new things.

I love how these common objects start to become historical artifacts because we are giving meaning to them, with our life. There are so many practices and rituals that allow us to imbue pieces of ourselves into objects.

In this workshop, we'll explore how technology can facilitate a new practice for archiving and sharing our personal histories. Together, we will

1. Choose a garment - either one you brought from home or one from Pubrobe's public wardrobe
2. Scan a pre-programmed NFC chip and use a web interface to document your garment's story
3. Create a personal patch using fabric collage techniques
4. Draw designs on your patch using fabric markers
5. Attach your completed patch to the garment using fabric glue
6. The visible alteration becomes an invitation for others to discover the digital stories embedded within

This approach builds on <a href="https://yoshinarinishio.net/works/pubrobe/">Pubrobe</a>, a public wardrobe project by Yoshinari Nishio, which welcomes the public to offer their clothes to each other as a common resource.

Each garment in that project carries the story that the previous owner had with it.

We will create a system that supports this accumulation of stories. New wearers can add their own story to the garment, and people you meet can add on their own memories to the garment's history. This creates evolving narrative objects. Each garment accumulates a growing archive of stories as it moves through different hands.

In daily life, the visible alteration creates opportunities for intimate exchange. When you meet friends and strangers, the design invites them to discover your story.

## NFC Technology

NFC stands for Near Field Communication. This technology allows two devices to communicate when they are very close together - within a few centimeters.

It's built on the same foundation as tapping your phone to pay.

Or riding the subway here in Japan.

## Ice-breaker Questions

I'd like to start by having a few people share stories about their favorite clothing items or the ones they brought today.

> If you brought a clothing item, what makes it special to you? or what about some of these Pubrobe garments is meaningful to you?

## Workshop Instructions

### 1. Record the memory

Each participant will receive a pre-programmed NFC chip. To connect it to your garment:

1. Hold your phone near the NFC chip
2. A notification will appear - tap it to open the web interface
3. You'll see a form where you can record your garment's story

The web interface allows you to document your garment's story:

### 1. Create Your Alteration Design

<div class="w-1/2">![](/workshops/worn-memory/worn-memory-patch.jpeg)</div>

Follow these steps to make your alteration:

    <strong>Spare Fabrics</strong>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>
        A variety of fabric pieces in different colors, textures, and patterns
      </li>
      <li>Cut these into interesting shapes to create your design</li>
      <li>
        Combine different pieces in a collage pattern to make a unique patch
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  />
  <strong>Fabric Pens</strong>
  <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
    <li>Use these to draw designs, patterns, or text on your fabric pieces</li>
    <li>Add personal symbols, dates, or decorative elements</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <div class="flex-1">
      <img src="/workshops/worn-memory/fabric-glue.jpg" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover pb-2" />
    <strong>Fabric Glue</strong>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>Use this to attach your collage pieces together</li>
      <li>Once your patch is complete, glue it onto your garment</li>
      <li>
        The glue creates a permanent bond that will last through wear and
        washing
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

**Step 1: Design Your Patch**

- Look through the spare fabrics and select pieces that speak to you
- Cut them into shapes that reflect your story or aesthetic
- Arrange them in a collage pattern - experiment with different combinations

**Step 2: Add Details**

- Use the fabric pens to draw on your fabric pieces
- Add patterns, text, symbols, or decorative elements
- Consider tracing your hand as a way to mark your presence

**Step 3: Assemble Your Patch**

- Use fabric glue to attach your collage pieces together
- Let the glue dry according to the instructions
- Make sure all edges are secure

**Step 4: Attach to Garment**

- Choose where on the garment your patch should go
- Apply fabric glue to the back of your completed patch
- Press firmly onto the garment and let dry
- This visible alteration becomes an invitation for others to discover your story
