# Field Companions: Worn Memory

You can always refer back to this website: https://spencer.place/worn-memory

## Introduction

My name is Spencer Chang. I'm an artist, designer, and engineer based in San Francisco. My work focuses on "communal computing" — forms of technology that bring people together and help us shape it for our imagination. I create "software you can touch," from websites that play out on your own devices and with personal data to interactive sculptures that invite intimate encounters between strangers to infrastructure that enables others to create their own forms of software.

I believe the internet and technology broadly is a mirror of our relationships to each other. I want it to feel as accessible of a creation material as writing is today.

## Webstones

You may have seen some of this work out there. Computing shrines are site-specific sculptures that create communal web interfaces. These physical installations allow people to access shared digital spaces through their phones at specific locations.

Field companions are everyday objects that become portals to digital memories. By embedding NFC chips into found objects and personal items, we create physical touchpoints for accessing digital experiences that matter to us.

All of these are artworks that combine physical and digital craft.

  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="computing-infused-objects" />
  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="field-companions" />
</div>

we'll call them webstones to describe objects that are embedded with software that is specific to them.

- idea is creating software for a specific object or place rather than something universal like typical software is created these days. This software is personal.
- started with webstones created my very first one
- field companions became a way to incorporate found materials with my own personality
- more experiments: fortune cookies,

Then, I started teaching workshops to share these ideas with others, in various forms: 1) creating sculptures out of clay and embedding software function in them, 2) embedding software into found and personal objects.

## [WORKSHOP] Field Companions: Worn Memory

In this workshop, we will embed stories inside clothing and create a system for passing down memories through generations.

One of my favorite things to do is buying secondhand items. Clothing, books, furniture, and art all have stories of their previous owners. Sometimes they are very obvious, like a jacket with the owner's name written on the label. Other times they give you intimate details without knowing who the person is, like the annotations in a book. Sometimes they are more subtle, like the small stains and scratches left in used chairs and tables. These things make these items more valuable to me than new things.

I love how these common objects start to become historical artifacts because we are giving meaning to them, with our life. There are so many practices and rituals that allow us to imbue pieces of ourselves into objects.

In this workshop, we'll explore how technology can facilitate a new practice for archiving and sharing our personal histories. Together, we will

1. Choose a garment - either one you brought from home or one from Pubrobe's public wardrobe
2. Scan a pre-programmed NFC chip and use a web interface to document your garment's story
3. Create a personal patch using fabric collage techniques
4. Draw designs on your patch using fabric markers
5. Attach your completed patch to the garment using fabric glue
6. The visible alteration becomes an invitation for others to discover the digital stories embedded within

<img src="https://yoshinarinishio.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pubrobe_01.jpg" />

This approach builds on <a href="https://yoshinarinishio.net/works/pubrobe/">Pubrobe</a>, a public wardrobe project by Yoshinari Nishio, which welcomes the public to offer their clothes to each other as a common resource.

Each garment in that project carries the story that the previous owner had with it.

We will create a system that supports the accumulation of stories. When someone passes the garment on, the next owner can add their own story before giving it away again. This creates evolving narrative objects. Each garment accumulates a growing archive of stories as it moves through different hands.

In daily life, the visible alteration creates opportunities for intimate exchange. When you meet friends and strangers, the design invites them to discover your story.

## Understanding NFC Technology

NFC stands for Near Field Communication. This technology allows two devices to communicate when they are very close together - within a few centimeters.

When you tap your phone to make a payment (Apple Pay, Google Pay, or other mobile payment systems), you are using NFC.

<div class="w-1/2">![Apple Pay](/assets/apple-pay.jpg)</div>

When you tap your phone or card to pay for subway or train tickets, you are using a form of NFC.

<div class="w-1/2">

</div>

Most modern smartphones have NFC capability built in. This technology has become standard over the past several years.

## Ice-breaker Questions

Please take a moment to introduce yourself and share:

- What clothing item did you bring today, or are you planning to use a garment from Pubrobe?
- If you brought something: What is your relationship to this piece?
- If you're using Pubrobe: What drew you to select a particular garment from the public wardrobe?
- Have you ever inherited or passed down clothing before?

## Workshop Instructions

Please follow these steps to create your worn memory:

### 1. Choose Your Garment

1. Use the garment you brought from home or
2. Select a garment from Pubrobe's public wardrobe to give new life to

### 2. Scan Your NFC Chip

Each participant will receive a pre-programmed NFC chip. To connect it to your garment:

1. Hold your phone near the NFC chip
2. A notification will appear - tap it to open the web interface
3. You'll see a form where you can record your garment's story

### 3. Using the Digital Interface

The web interface allows you to document your garment's story:

<div class="w-1/2">
  <img src="/workshops/worn-memory/worn-memory-ui.jpeg" />
</div>

In the interface, you can:

- **Share your memories**: Did you have a meaningful day with it when you wore it?
- **Log your wear**: How many times did you wear it? When did you last wear it?
- **View the archive**: See stories from previous owners (if this garment has been passed down before)

When you pass the garment to someone else in the future, they will scan the same NFC chip, see your story in the archive, and add their own story to the collection. Each garment becomes a living record of all the people who have worn it.

### 4. Materials Available

You will have access to various materials to create your personal alteration:

    <strong>Spare Fabrics</strong>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>
        A variety of fabric pieces in different colors, textures, and patterns
      </li>
      <li>Cut these into interesting shapes to create your design</li>
      <li>
        Combine different pieces in a collage pattern to make a unique patch
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <strong>Fabric Glue</strong>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>Use this to attach your collage pieces together</li>
      <li>Once your patch is complete, glue it onto your garment</li>
      <li>
        The glue creates a permanent bond that will last through wear and
        washing
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

### 5. Create Your Design

<div class="w-1/2">![](/workshops/worn-memory/worn-memory-patch.jpeg)</div>

Follow these steps to make your alteration:

**Step 1: Design Your Patch**

- Look through the spare fabrics and select pieces that speak to you
- Cut them into shapes that reflect your story or aesthetic
- Arrange them in a collage pattern - experiment with different combinations

**Step 2: Add Details**

- Use the fabric pens to draw on your fabric pieces
- Add patterns, text, symbols, or decorative elements
- Consider tracing your hand as a way to mark your presence

**Step 3: Assemble Your Patch**

- Use fabric glue to attach your collage pieces together
- Let the glue dry according to the instructions
- Make sure all edges are secure

**Step 4: Attach to Garment**

- Choose where on the garment your patch should go
- Apply fabric glue to the back of your completed patch
- Press firmly onto the garment and let dry
- This visible alteration becomes an invitation for others to discover your story

<div class="w-1/2">![](/workshops/worn-memory/worn-memory-garment.jpeg)</div>

### 6. Consider the Future

As you create, think about:

- What makes this garment meaningful to you?
- What story do you want to preserve about your relationship with it?
- When you pass this garment on, what do you want the next person to know?
- How can your design reflect your personal style while inviting interaction?

## The Future of Your Garment

Worn memory creates objects that grow over time. When you are ready to pass your garment to someone else, they can:

1. Scan the NFC chip to read all the previous stories
2. Use the same web interface to add their own story to the archive
3. Create their own alteration or patch to add to the design
4. Pass it on again when they are ready

Each garment becomes a living archive. It accumulates voices, relationships, and memories as it moves through different hands. The physical patches layer upon each other, just as the digital stories accumulate in the archive.
