# Field Companions: Worn Memory

You can always refer back to this website: https://spencer.place/worn-memory

## Introduction

My name is Spencer Chang. I am an independent engineer and internet artist based in San Francisco. My work explores communal computing - ways that computers can bring people together and help us shape technology toward what we care about.

I create experiments that examine our relationship with technology and with each other through technology. These include seasonal websites, open-source tools for building small social networks, and physical objects embedded with digital memories.

## Background: My Practice

Over the past several years, I have been exploring how we can create more intimate and meaningful relationships with digital technology. This work takes several forms.

### Internet Environments

<div class="flex flex-row gap-4 items-center">
  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="everyday" />
  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="alive-internet-theory" />
  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="poems-we-found-with-the-internet" />
</div>

TODO: Internet works, spaces for people to participate, environments to immerse in, experiences that subvert your normal expectations of the internet and technology

### Infrastructure

<div class="flex flex-row gap-4 items-center">
  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="playhtml" />
  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="gift-interfaces" />
  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="touching-computers-creating-data-talismans" />
</div>

TODO: Tools, infarstructure, teaching, etc.

### Interactive Sculpture

<div class="flex flex-row gap-4 items-center">
  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="computing-shrines" />
  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="computing-infused-objects" />
  <SelectedCreationSummary slug="field-companions" />
</div>

These ceramic internet sculptures contain RFID chips. Each piece serves as a physical key to digital content, creating a tangible connection between physical objects and online spaces.

Computing shrines are site-specific sculptures that create communal web interfaces. These physical installations allow people to access shared digital spaces through their phones at specific locations.

Field companions are everyday objects that become portals to digital memories. By embedding NFC chips into found objects and personal items, we create physical touchpoints for accessing digital experiences that matter to us.

## [WORKSHOP] Field Companions: Worn Memory

In this workshop, we will embed stories inside clothing and create a system for passing down memories through generations.

One of my favorite things to do is buying secondhand items. Clothing, books, furniture, and art all have stories of their previous owners. Sometimes they are very obvious, like a jacket with the owner's name written on the label. Other times they give you intimate details without knowing who the person is, like the annotations in a book. Sometimes they are more subtle, like the small stains and scratches left in used chairs and tables. These things make these items more valuable to me than new things.

I love how these common objects start to become historical artifacts because we are giving meaning to them, with our life. There are so many practices and rituals that allow us to imbue pieces of ourselves into objects.

In this workshop, we'll explore how technology can facilitate a new practice for archiving and sharing our personal histories. Together, we will

1. Choose a garment - either one you brought from home or one from Pubrobe's public wardrobe
2. Scan a pre-programmed NFC chip and use a web interface to document your garment's story
3. Create a personal patch using fabric collage techniques
4. Draw designs on your patch using fabric markers
5. Attach your completed patch to the garment using fabric glue
6. The visible alteration becomes an invitation for others to discover the digital stories embedded within

<img src="https://yoshinarinishio.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pubrobe_01.jpg" />

This approach builds on <a href="https://yoshinarinishio.net/works/pubrobe/">Pubrobe</a>, a public wardrobe project by Yoshinari Nishio, which welcomes the public to offer their clothes to each other as a common resource.

Each garment in that project carries the story that the previous owner had with it.

Our system allows for growth over time. When someone passes the garment on, the next owner can add their own story before giving it away again. This creates evolving narrative objects. Each garment accumulates a growing archive of stories as it moves through different hands.

In daily life, the visible alteration creates opportunities for intimate exchange. When you meet friends and strangers, the design invites them to discover your story.

## Understanding NFC Technology

NFC stands for Near Field Communication. This technology allows two devices to communicate when they are very close together - within a few centimeters.

When you tap your phone to make a payment (Apple Pay, Google Pay, or other mobile payment systems), you are using NFC.

<div class="w-1/2">![Apple Pay](/assets/apple-pay.jpg)</div>

When you tap your phone or card to pay for subway or train tickets, you are using a form of NFC.

<div class="w-1/2">

</div>

Most modern smartphones have NFC capability built in. This technology has become standard over the past several years.

## Ice-breaker Questions

Please take a moment to introduce yourself and share:

- What clothing item did you bring today, or are you planning to use a garment from Pubrobe?
- If you brought something: What is your relationship to this piece?
- If you're using Pubrobe: What drew you to select a particular garment from the public wardrobe?
- Have you ever inherited or passed down clothing before?

## Workshop Instructions

Please follow these steps to create your worn memory:

### 1. Choose Your Garment

You have two options:

- Bring a garment from home that holds personal meaning
- Select a garment from Pubrobe's public wardrobe to give new life to

### 2. Scan Your NFC Chip

Each participant will receive a pre-programmed NFC chip. To connect it to your garment:

1. Hold your phone near the NFC chip (you don't need any special app - your phone's camera or default NFC reader will detect it)
2. A notification will appear - tap it to open the web interface
3. You'll see a form where you can record your garment's story

### 3. Using the Digital Interface

The web interface allows you to document your garment's story:

<div class="w-1/2">
  <img src="/workshops/worn-memory/worn-memory-ui.jpeg" />
</div>

In the interface, you can:

- **Describe the garment**: What is it? What does it look like? What condition is it in?
- **Share your story**: Why does this garment matter to you? What memories does it hold? Where did it come from?
- **Add photos**: Capture images of your garment and your alterations
- **View the archive**: See stories from previous owners (if this garment has been passed down before)

When you pass the garment to someone else in the future, they will scan the same NFC chip, see your story in the archive, and add their own story to the collection. Each garment becomes a living record of all the people who have worn it.

### 4. Materials Available

You will have access to various materials to create your personal alteration:

    <img
      src="/workshops/worn-memory/spare-fabric.jpg"
      class="w-full pb-2 aspect-square object-cover"
    />
    <strong>Spare Fabrics</strong>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>
        A variety of fabric pieces in different colors, textures, and patterns
      </li>
      <li>Cut these into interesting shapes to create your design</li>
      <li>
        Combine different pieces in a collage pattern to make a unique patch
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    class="w-full aspect-square object-cover pb-2"
  />
  <strong>Fabric Pens</strong>
  <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
    <li>Black and white fabric markers</li>
    <li>Use these to draw designs, patterns, or text on your fabric pieces</li>
    <li>Add personal symbols, dates, or decorative elements</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <div class="flex-1">
      <img src="/workshops/worn-memory/fabric-glue.jpg" class="w-full aspect-square object-cover pb-2" />
    <strong>Fabric Glue</strong>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>Use this to attach your collage pieces together</li>
      <li>Once your patch is complete, glue it onto your garment</li>
      <li>
        The glue creates a permanent bond that will last through wear and
        washing
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

### 5. Create Your Design

<div class="w-1/2">![](/workshops/worn-memory/worn-memory-patch.jpeg)</div>

Follow these steps to make your alteration:

**Step 1: Design Your Patch**

- Look through the spare fabrics and select pieces that speak to you
- Cut them into shapes that reflect your story or aesthetic
- Arrange them in a collage pattern - experiment with different combinations

**Step 2: Add Details**

- Use the fabric pens to draw on your fabric pieces
- Add patterns, text, symbols, or decorative elements
- Consider tracing your hand as a way to mark your presence

**Step 3: Assemble Your Patch**

- Use fabric glue to attach your collage pieces together
- Let the glue dry according to the instructions
- Make sure all edges are secure

**Step 4: Attach to Garment**

- Choose where on the garment your patch should go
- Apply fabric glue to the back of your completed patch
- Press firmly onto the garment and let dry
- This visible alteration becomes an invitation for others to discover your story

<div class="w-1/2">![](/workshops/worn-memory/worn-memory-garment.jpeg)</div>

### 6. Consider the Future

As you create, think about:

- What makes this garment meaningful to you?
- What story do you want to preserve about your relationship with it?
- When you pass this garment on, what do you want the next person to know?
- How can your design reflect your personal style while inviting interaction?

## The Future of Your Garment

Worn memory creates objects that grow over time. When you are ready to pass your garment to someone else, they can:

1. Scan the NFC chip to read all the previous stories
2. Use the same web interface to add their own story to the archive
3. Create their own alteration or patch to add to the design
4. Pass it on again when they are ready

Each garment becomes a living archive. It accumulates voices, relationships, and memories as it moves through different hands. The physical patches layer upon each other, just as the digital stories accumulate in the archive.
