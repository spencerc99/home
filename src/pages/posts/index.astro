    <em>everything I've written about.</em>

    <p>
      All my public writing is here in some form. I write for emotional
      resonance, so if something I’ve written strikes a chord, please send me a
      note!

          I first caught the writing bug in third grade when I wrote a story
          about a wizard on a space adventure, but I treated the bug as an
          infection--a distraction from the “professional” classes that I needed
          to pursue the STEM career my parents desired for me. Math and science
          were to come before magical incantations and ethical dilemmas. In
          college, I found the freedom to explore my writing alongside my
          academic obligations of computer science and calculus and accounting
          and started a blog to share my inner thoughts with the world. Since
          then, I’ve continued to write on my blog (which has transformed into
          this website) in both reflective posts, argumentative essays, and
          short flash-like fiction and maintain a personal <a
            href="https://spencerchang.substack.com/">newsletter</a
          > where I share thoughts and updates and personal essays.
        </p>
        <p>
          I end up setting aside time every day before I start work to write and
          explore and sometimes find myself seized with bursts of inspiration
          that I must empty onto paper in the early morning hours. I rigorously
          give myself space to write even though I’m primarily a writer of
          passion because writing is how I think, explore, and dream. It’s my
          submarine to probe into the depths of my subconscious and excavate
          those submerged emotions and cravings. It’s my limitless blank canvas,
          where I can freely shape rules and assumptions as I please to convey a
          feeling or traverse an experiment. It’s the portal to entirely new
          worlds and universes, where I can play both god, in manifesting my
          emotions in the literary flesh, and the background observer, in
          watching how the characters and systems develop naturally in that
          artificial environment.
