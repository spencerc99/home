# Touching Computers: NFC as Ritual, Memory, and Interface

You can always refer back to this website! https://spencer.place/webstones

## hi i'm spencer

i'm an indie engineer & internet artist. I make various experiments with computers that broadly focus on communal computing, or how computers can bring people together and empower us to shape technology towards what we care about.

Whether a seasonal website, an open-source library for making tiny social networks, or webstones, these works all explore a new relationship to technology and to each other through technology.

## hi i'm munus!

i'm a taiwanese haklo-hakka artist, designer and teacher in brooklyn (lenapehoking). I explore how code can be a tool for identity, memory, and solidarity, often through experiments that blur the line between software and social practice.

whether it’s a collaborative [zine-coding library](https://github.com/munusshih/p5.genzine), [a store where people can exchange their time for design services](https://www.munusshih.com/duty-free), or [a database that documents immigrant stories](https://www.munusshih.com/guansi), my work asks how we can make technology more critical, relational, and intentional.

## Mini ice-breaker

- why did people come to this workshop?
- what do you want to get out of it?
- did you bring an object with you? what did you bring?

## What's an NFC?

NFC (Near Field Communication) lets two devices talk to each other when they're really close...like a few inches apart.

You’ve probably used it without knowing:
Tapping your phone to pay (like Apple Pay or Google Pay)? That’s NFC.

Paying for a subway ride with your phone? That’s NFC too!

In Taiwan, people use a card called EasyCard to tap and pay for the subway, buses, and even at some convenience stores. There are all kinds of fun and creative designs for the card’s “shell”.

From cute keychains and plushies to Pokémon balls!

## what is a webstone?

## How does it work?

NFC chips are the same technology you use for Apple Pay, transit cards, etc. People also use them as business cards, but we're gonna make something that fits the function.

</div>

At this point, most phones work, but it's been a slow adoption process since the technology was first introduced.

// TBD: Munus to add examples of their work with NFC

## Working with Clay

As we pass out the materials, please introduce yourselves to the person next to you! You'll be helping each other work with clay and programming your computers.

- **SKETCH FIRST**: clay gets "worked" fast. try to get to a general shape of what you want to make first and then smooth out cracks with water and create details with more bits of clay
- **NFC TAG**: you want to make your full shape and then put the nfc in a place where you cover it with another layer of clay
  - think about where you want the phone to tap for your design
  - you can always rewrite / reprogram the nfc chip
- **THICKER TO BE SAFE**: thinner pieces are more delicate and may crack as they dry, so try to give everything a pretty good thickness (recommended at least a quarter-half inch.

## Programming the Computing Function

Downlood NFC TOOLS on iOS or Android to program.

## Gifting Exercise

Let's make something to gift to someone here! We'll make a vessel to hold a note for someone else in the room. Write a wish or reminder for them.

# Guiding Questions

- Maybe come up with guided questions?
- When do you feel closer to your heritage?
- What media or experiences have facilitated this?
  E.g. when listening to music, when eating certain food, when looking at feng shui…
- What reminds you of your family history?
- What stories do your object(s) tell?
- Which cultures does your identity reflect?

## Finishing the Webstone at home

- let it dry overnight for at least a couple days. preferably near a window with indirect light (direct light may dry it too quickly and cause more cracks)
- painting it: any kind of acrylic paint (available at your local arts store or amazon)
- finishing it: mod podge, <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Liquitex-5004-Professional-Medium-Firnis/dp/B000KNNJW8?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&psc=1&smid=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&language=de_DE">acrylic varnish</a>, lacquer varnish (all available at your local arts store or amazon)
