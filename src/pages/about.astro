      Their practice—spanning internet spaces, interactive sculpture, and
      creative infrastructure—transforms technology from a tool for
      institutional control into one for collective well-being. These works
      leverage whimsical intimacy to interrogate our systems, invite active
      imagination to reinvent them, and finally, equip us with the means to do
      so. Combining design and art into “useful art”, their tools, games, and
      spaces question what websites are, who we can be through the internet, and
      how technology might become a public good.

      Chang's work has been showcased and supported internationally, including
      Hyundai Artlab (Seoul), Tokyo Geidai (Tokyo), Gray Area (San Francisco),
      CultureHub (New York), WSA (New York), the Museum of Moving Image (New
      York), Alserkal Avenue (Dubai), and the de Young Museum (San Francisco).
      Their projects have been featured in MIT Technology Review, It's Nice
      That, and Frieze, and supported through grants by the San Francisco Arts
      Commission, APOSSIBLE, and the Ethereum Foundation. A NEW INC (New Museum)

      the School for Poetic Computation, Stanford University, and the Asian Art
      Museum, among others around the world.

      <details>
        <summary class="text-lg"> 1. why the internet? </summary>
        <p>
          Growing up, I never felt like I fit in at school or local communities.
          Instead, I grew up on the internet. The internet was where I found my
          community, learned what it meant to have a passion, and discovered the
          range of humanity—how tender and how heartless people could be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this, I am driven to understand and create spaces that
          allow for people to be seen: their lives, sorrows, and dreams. The
          internet is increasingly the medium for this, from our constant
          encounters with the supercomputers in our pockets to the pleas to be
          seen in every comment and corner of the web. Grappling directly with
          the tension between the oppressive bases of technology and its role as
          a global source for connection, meaning, and agency, my work
          speculates what the internet might look like if these were in harmony
          by offering living systems that do so. Varying between spaces that
          invite new ways for seeing each other digitally, tools for creating
          new methods of connection, and objects that inspire whimsical intimacy
          with our devices, I am always in search of a form of technology that
          lives as we do.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="text-lg"> 2. what is your goal? </summary>
        <p>
          That we live in a world where the technology we make and advance feels
          as fundamentally human as humanities or cultural work. That we live in
          a world where we aren't trying to get away from our phones and remove
          technology, where our idea of technology is not so dominated by
          capitalism and surveillance, where it can be used for fun things,
          poetic things, things that have no reason for existing other than the
          fact that someone wanted them to. A world where technology is as
          natural a medium for bringing us closer together as public space is.
